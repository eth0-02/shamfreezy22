title: A brand new view
excerpt: >-
  Two top real estate agents have gone from being competitors to partners, creating a brand new agency in Gothenburg. In order to stand out in a fast-moving market amidst tough competition, they needed a strong visual identity. They appointed us as their lead brand agency (hurrah!), and this is the result.

## Well-established and innovative thinking

Ny vy wanted their identity to convey a well-established, confident company that also dares to be brave and think along new lines. With that in mind we created a flexible identity with plenty of pride. Ny vy has become a clear and distinct brand. Their identity features a varied and dynamic colour scale, a warm and welcoming tone and a smooth and soft personality that also stands out. In other words – a new view.

## Corporate values

The identity we created has now been implemented in Ny vy’s office space, on their website and in all marketing materials. Together with Ny vy we also identified and developed the company’s corporate values in order to emphasise and clarify who they are and who they want to become as a company.

_Note to non-Swedish speaking readers: The company’s name Ny vy means ‘new view’ in English._
