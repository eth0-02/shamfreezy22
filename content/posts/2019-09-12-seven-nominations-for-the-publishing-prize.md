This year Strateg has been nominated no less than SEVEN times for the Publishing Prize, and, of course, we’re extremely proud and happy! The nominated entries are a website for ÖBO, an annual financial statement for Hemsö, the WER magalogue, along with films for Posti Messaging, Grythyttans Gästgivaregård, Familjerådgivningen/Region Örebro County and Arbesko.

On top of that came two nominations for Svenska Designpriset: in the Infographic category for our work with Telia and in the Graphic Identity category for our work with real estate agent Ny vy. Yay!
