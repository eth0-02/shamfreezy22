Francesco Mussi is a sporty Italian who’s looking forward to moving to Sweden. He likes anime, trains, his Latvian girlfriend, coffee, books and travelling.

** You’re a super-skilled developer, but what are you bad at? ** <br />
– I’m actually terrible at bowling and karaoke. I seriously hate karaoke

Patrik Nilsson is from Gothenburg, has a really bad sense of direction (hence loves Google Maps), used to live in Bangkok, loves to watch football with family and friends and are afraid of heights.

** Name one thing you’re proud of! ** <br />
– Finding a job that I love to do. Web developing is my job, but it’s also my hobby.
