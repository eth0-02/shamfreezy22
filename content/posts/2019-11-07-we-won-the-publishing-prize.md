This year Strateg was nominated no less than SEVEN times for the Publishing Prize, and guess what? We won first prize for our work with Familjerådgivningen (client: Region Örebro County). We came in second place with our beautiful Christmas film for Grythyttans Gästgivaregård, and our film for the shoemaker’s company Arbesko was awarded a bronze medal. Our work with ÖBO’s website was also appreciated by the jury and came in third in its category.

We would like to say a warm thank you to our lovely, brave clients for patiently considering all of the – sometimes challenging – ideas we are presenting. But now, let’s celebrate!
