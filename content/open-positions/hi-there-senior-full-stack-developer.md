## About your new role

As a Full Stack developer at Strateg, you work on projects with clients from industrials and state owned companies to startups. You work closely with copywriters, designers, UX, planners and developers

* Very good understanding of JavaScript
* PHP
* Wordpress, Sitevision or other CMS

### Basic understanding

* Version control (Git)
* MySQL

### Bonus

* Laravel

## Who you are

As a Full Stack developer, you can build a web project from scratch to finish in accordance with the best practices. In collaborative projects, you can take the lead sometimes because proactivity is in your genes. You can clearly communicate your ideas to your teammates and implement them in a project. You’ll assist others when they’re in need because you like to help and share your knowledge. You are passionate and open-minded, and meticulous about your work.

## Good to know

At Strateg, we care about quality and improvement. That’s why, once a week, we have peer code reviews, and hackathon afternoons where one has the ability to work on their own project to learn and experience new languages and technologies.

We also truly value having fun together. We arrange different kinds of activities such as karaoke bar, movie- and theatre nights and every morning at nine o’clock, we gather together for breakfast.

## About Strateg

Strateg is a part of the Diplomat Group with fellow subsidiaries Diplomat Communications and Tale. Together we form one of Sweden’s leading communications advisers. Some 70 employees work at Strateg, with an unusually large dedication and broad expertise to ensure our customers’ success.
